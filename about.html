    <h1> About Us</h1>

    <p> We are a group of 2 girls taking part in the Code First Girls course to learn how to code. Our names are Lorna and Rachel.</p>
    <p> This is the first website we have made and it is to provide information for new students coming to Glasgow on what life is like here</p>
    <p> Code First Girls has taught us how to use:</p>
     <ul>
